import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react"

// The Idea
// React Context lets you share data without prop drilling.
// But hereâ€™s the gotcha:
// Whenever the context value changes, all components that consume that context re-render.
// If you stuff a big object into one context, any change to any field forces all consumers to re-render â€” even if they donâ€™t use the changed field.
// This is what we want to avoid â†’ so we split contexts by responsibility.


// What Happens Here:
// UserInfo is subscribed only to UserContext.
// Toggling theme doesnâ€™t affect it â†’ no re-render.
// Header re-renders only when theme changes.

// When to use it?
// Use split contexts in larger apps where different parts of the UI need different data independently.
// For very large apps, sometimes you combine Context + memoization or even switch to state management libraries (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.) for fine-grained contr

// WARNING
// here is just an example because the correct way to do it is to split this context in two separate files because
// Even though user never changes, its provider is still in the JSX tree.
// If React decides to re-render the parent (SplitContexts) â†’ all its children (Header + UserInfo) re-render.
// In your code, SplitContexts re-renders every time theme changes, because the useState for theme lives inside it.
// That causes the JSX tree to re-run, which includes <UserInfo/>.

const ThemeContext = createContext<any>(null);
