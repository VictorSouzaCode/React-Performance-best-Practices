// What does "lifting state" mean?
// Lifting state = moving a piece of state up into a parent component so multiple children can access or share it.
// Example: You often lift state when two components need to know about the same data.

// The Problem: State lifted too high
// When you lift state higher than necessary:
// Parent re-renders on every update.
// All children re-render even if only one child actually needed the change.
// This wastes work and makes the UI feel slower, especially with large trees.

// imagine we lift both countersâ€™ state to the parent:
// When A updates, the parent re-renders.
// Because the parent re-renders, both A and B display elements re-render even though only A changed.
// With many counters â†’ huge wasted work.
